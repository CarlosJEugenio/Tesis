abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The purpose of this study is to present the theory and examine the in vitro accuracy of a new ultrasound dilution cardiac output measurement technology in which an extracorporeal arteriovenous tubing loop is inserted between existing arterial and venous catheters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Laboratory experiments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Research laboratory.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS: None.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS: None.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro validations of cardiac output, central blood volume, total end-diastolic volume, and active circulation volume were performed in a model mimicking pediatric (children 2-10 kg) and neonatal (0.5-3 kg) flows and volumes against flows and volumes measured volumetrically. Reusable sensors were clamped onto the arterial and venous limbs of the arteriovenous loop. A peristaltic pump was used to circulate liquid at 6-12 mL/min from the artery to the vein through the arteriovenous loop. Body temperature injections of isotonic saline (0.3-10 mL) were performed. In the pediatric setting, the absolute difference between cardiac output measured by dilution and cardiac output measured volumetrically was 3.97{\%} +/- 2.97{\%} (range 212-1200 mL/min); for central blood volume the difference was 4.59{\%} +/- 3.14{\%} (range 59-315 mL); for total end-diastolic volume the difference was 4.10{\%} +/- 3.08{\%} (range 24-211 mL); and for active circulation volume the difference was 3.30{\%} +/- 3.07{\%} (range 247-645 mL). In the neonatal setting the difference for cardiac output was 4.40{\%} +/- 4.09{\%} (range 106-370 mL/min); for central blood volume the difference was 4.90{\%} +/- 3.69{\%} (range 50-62 mL); and for active circulation volume the difference was 5.39{\%} +/- 4.42{\%} (range 104-247 mL).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In vitro validation confirmed the ability of the ultrasound dilution technology to accurately measure small flows and volumes required for hemodynamic assessments in small pediatric and neonatal patients. Clinical studies are in progress to assess the reliability of this technology under different clinical situations.},

@book{Kooi2008,
abstract = {Atomic and molecular line astrophysics is demanding enhanced capabilities in terms of frequency coverage, spectral resolution, bandwidth, sensitivity, stability (quality of the data products), frequency agility, and ease of use. To help fulfill these demanding requirements, this thesis investigates advanced heterodyne receiver techniques in the submillimeter and terahertz frequency regimes. This thesis begins with a brief introduction to the field of submillimeter and terahertz astronomy. From there it proceeds to outline the submillimeter detection and operational requirements in Chapter{\~{}}2. This is an important Chapter as boundary conditions are defined for the astronomical instrumentation we concern ourselves with. Once the operational requirements are established a variety of receiver configurations are introduced in Chapter{\~{}}3. In particular we touch upon the concepts and implementations of the double sideband (DSB) single-ended receiver, the balanced receiver, the correlation receiver, and the sideband separating receiver. At its core, frequency down-conversion or heterodyning is accomplished with an highly non-linear mixing element. In the submillimeter, below 1000{\~{}}GHz, SIS tunnel junctions are now commonly employed thanks to their superior conversion gain and sensitivity. In the terahertz regime, at frequencies beyond 1000{\~{}}GHz, hot-electron bolometer mixers are at the present time the element of choice. The mixing process in both mixers is fundamentally very different. In Chapter{\~{}}4 we address the physics of each device, and look in detail into a number of device related peculiarities. With the theory covered, the focus shifts in subsequent Chapters to a variety of realized receiver designs in the laboratory and on the telescope. We address in Chapter{\~{}}5 an all NbTiN film quasi-optical mixer that operates in the 800{\~{}}--{\~{}}920{\~{}}GHz atmospheric window. As a result of our work, low loss and high energy gap NbTiN superconducting films have been demonstrated, and since then been incorporated in the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-infrared (HIFI) mixers bands 3, 4, and 5. Also in Chapter{\~{}}5 we explore for the first time the use of an AlN tunnel barrier. The results were so impressive that this technology is currently being baselined at institutions like JPL, TU Delft, the University of Virginia, and the University of K"oln. In Chapter{\~{}}6, our research leads the way to addressing such important issues as the IF bandwidth and mixer gain of (NbN) hot electron bolometers. Then in Chapter{\~{}}7 a recently installed (at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO)) double sideband high-current density AlN-barrier SIS Technology development receiver (Trex) is introduced. Trex was constructed to prove many of the underlying technologies required in advanced receiver designs (Chapter{\~{}}8). At the present time Trex serves as a facility heterodyne instrument for high spectral resolution wide bandwidth observations, and extended observations with the Harvard Smithsonian submillimeter array (SMA). In the first part of Chapter{\~{}}8 we look in detail at the theory, characteristics, and implementation of balanced receivers, designed to cover the important 180{\~{}}--{\~{}}720{\~{}}GHz atmospheric window(s). The second part of Chapter{\~{}}8 discusses a correlation, or continuous comparison, receiver to operate between 280{\~{}}--{\~{}}420{\~{}}GHz (covers two atmospheric windows with one SIS mixer). Finally, the last Section of Chapter{\~{}}8 concerns itself with a 600{\~{}}--{\~{}}720{\~{}}GHz (ALMA band 9) sideband separating receiver. Theory, implementation, and measurement results are presented. This is the first time a sideband separating receiver has been implemented at such a high frequency. In our treatment, instantaneous signal and IF bandwidth, sensitivity, and sideband ratio are important considerations. An important, so far un-discussed, receiver concept is the heterodyne focal plane array. Future astronomical developments will increasingly demand the mapping speed enhancement afforded by multi-pixel focal plane arrays. This thesis devotes Chapter{\~{}}9 towards integrated arrays receivers with actual realized devices and measurement results. In all of the above outlined receiver designs, instrument stability is of primary importance. It affects the observed baseline quality and integration efficiency. Indeed, there are many ways in which the stability of the receiver may be compromised. The theory and actual measurement results are presented in Chapter{\~{}}10.},
