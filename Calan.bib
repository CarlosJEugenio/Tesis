abstract = {This report describes work done towards a new generation of receivers for ALMA Band 6. While this work is focused on Band 6, much of it could be applied to all eight of the ALMA bands which use SIS receivers, namely Bands 3-10. Two aspects of the current Band-6 receivers can be improved: the receiver noise temperature can be made flatter across the RF and IF bands, and the gain variation across the IF band can be reduced. The eventual goal is to have relatively flat noise temperature and gain across the full 211-275 GHz Band 6 and across a full 4-12 GHz IF band. Three possible approaches are being studied: (i) the configuration of the front-end; (ii) the use of balanced IF preamplifiers; and (iii) SIS mixers with a wider RF bandwidth. 1. Front-end configuration Several configurations are possible for receivers using sideband-separating and balanced mixers, and this section considers the relative merits of these. Sideband-separating mixers are used on ALMA Bands 3-8 as a means of reducing the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, but LO sideband noise also contributes a significant component of the system noise at some LO and intermediate frequencies, and this can potentially be reduced by using a balanced mixer configuration. Here, the input characteristics of balanced and sideband-separating mixers with quadrature and 180E input hybrids are examined. Like the balanced amplifier, balanced and sideband-separating mixers using a quadrature input hybrid are inherently well matched. The levels of the signals emerging from the input port at the image and LO frequencies are also important in some applications, as are the down-converted local oscillator sideband noise and the thermal noise contribution of the fourth-port termination on the input hybrid. These depend on the mixer configuration. These effects are considered for balanced and sideband-separating mixers of the four basic types depicted in Figs. 1-4. All have input hybrids, either quadrature or 180E. Quadrature hybrids can be of the coupled transmission line or branch-line types, and 180E hybrids can use a magic-T, Wilkinson power divider, rat-race, or a simple transformer. In practice, 0E or 180E three-port power splitters are sometimes used in place of 180E hybrids, but these can lead to degradation of mixer performance due to reflection of even-or odd-mode signal components which would be terminated in the fourth-port load of a full four-port hybrid.},

@phdthesis{Kooi2008,
abstract = {Atomic and molecular line astrophysics is demanding enhanced capabilities in terms of frequency coverage, spectral resolution, bandwidth, sensitivity, stability (quality of the data products), frequency agility, and ease of use. To help fulfill these demanding requirements, this thesis investigates advanced heterodyne receiver techniques in the submillimeter and terahertz frequency regimes. This thesis begins with a brief introduction to the field of submillimeter and terahertz astronomy. From there it proceeds to outline the submillimeter detection and operational requirements in Chapter{\~{}}2. This is an important Chapter as boundary conditions are defined for the astronomical instrumentation we concern ourselves with. Once the operational requirements are established a variety of receiver configurations are introduced in Chapter{\~{}}3. In particular we touch upon the concepts and implementations of the double sideband (DSB) single-ended receiver, the balanced receiver, the correlation receiver, and the sideband separating receiver. At its core, frequency down-conversion or heterodyning is accomplished with an highly non-linear mixing element. In the submillimeter, below 1000{\~{}}GHz, SIS tunnel junctions are now commonly employed thanks to their superior conversion gain and sensitivity. In the terahertz regime, at frequencies beyond 1000{\~{}}GHz, hot-electron bolometer mixers are at the present time the element of choice. The mixing process in both mixers is fundamentally very different. In Chapter{\~{}}4 we address the physics of each device, and look in detail into a number of device related peculiarities. With the theory covered, the focus shifts in subsequent Chapters to a variety of realized receiver designs in the laboratory and on the telescope. We address in Chapter{\~{}}5 an all NbTiN film quasi-optical mixer that operates in the 800{\~{}}--{\~{}}920{\~{}}GHz atmospheric window. As a result of our work, low loss and high energy gap NbTiN superconducting films have been demonstrated, and since then been incorporated in the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-infrared (HIFI) mixers bands 3, 4, and 5. Also in Chapter{\~{}}5 we explore for the first time the use of an AlN tunnel barrier. The results were so impressive that this technology is currently being baselined at institutions like JPL, TU Delft, the University of Virginia, and the University of K"oln. In Chapter{\~{}}6, our research leads the way to addressing such important issues as the IF bandwidth and mixer gain of (NbN) hot electron bolometers. Then in Chapter{\~{}}7 a recently installed (at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO)) double sideband high-current density AlN-barrier SIS Technology development receiver (Trex) is introduced. Trex was constructed to prove many of the underlying technologies required in advanced receiver designs (Chapter{\~{}}8). At the present time Trex serves as a facility heterodyne instrument for high spectral resolution wide bandwidth observations, and extended observations with the Harvard Smithsonian submillimeter array (SMA). In the first part of Chapter{\~{}}8 we look in detail at the theory, characteristics, and implementation of balanced receivers, designed to cover the important 180{\~{}}--{\~{}}720{\~{}}GHz atmospheric window(s). The second part of Chapter{\~{}}8 discusses a correlation, or continuous comparison, receiver to operate between 280{\~{}}--{\~{}}420{\~{}}GHz (covers two atmospheric windows with one SIS mixer). Finally, the last Section of Chapter{\~{}}8 concerns itself with a 600{\~{}}--{\~{}}720{\~{}}GHz (ALMA band 9) sideband separating receiver. Theory, implementation, and measurement results are presented. This is the first time a sideband separating receiver has been implemented at such a high frequency. In our treatment, instantaneous signal and IF bandwidth, sensitivity, and sideband ratio are important considerations. An important, so far un-discussed, receiver concept is the heterodyne focal plane array. Future astronomical developments will increasingly demand the mapping speed enhancement afforded by multi-pixel focal plane arrays. This thesis devotes Chapter{\~{}}9 towards integrated arrays receivers with actual realized devices and measurement results. In all of the above outlined receiver designs, instrument stability is of primary importance. It affects the observed baseline quality and integration efficiency. Indeed, there are many ways in which the stability of the receiver may be compromised. The theory and actual measurement results are presented in Chapter{\~{}}10.},
