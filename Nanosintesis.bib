Suspension ???150??nm above a Si/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report the synthesis of ultra-low-density three-dimensional macroassemblies of graphene sheets that exhibit high electrical conductivities and large internal surface areas. These materials are prepared as monolithic solids from suspensions of single-layer graphene oxide in which organic sol-gel chemistry is used to cross-link the individual sheets. The resulting gels are supercritically dried and then thermally reduced to yield graphene aerogels with densities approaching 10 mg/cm(3). In contrast to methods that utilize physical cross-links between GO, this approach provides covalent carbon bonding between the graphene sheets. These graphene aerogels exhibit an improvement in bulk electrical conductivity of more than 2 orders of magnitude (∼1 × 10(2) S/m) compared to graphene assemblies with physical cross-links alone (∼5 × 10(-1) S/m). The graphene aerogels also possess large surface areas (584 m(2)/g) and pore volumes (2.96 cm(3)/g), making these materials viable candidates for use in energy storage, catalysis, and sensing applications.},

abstract = {Because of graphene's anticipated applications in electronics and its thermal, mechanical, and optical properties, many scientists and engineers are interested in this material. Graphene is an isolated layer of the $\pi$-stacked hexagonal allotrope of carbon known as graphite. The interlayer cohesive energy of graphite, or exfoliation energy, that results from van der Waals attractions over the interlayer spacing distance of 3.34 {\AA} (61 meV/C atom) is many times weaker than the intralayer covalent bonding. Since graphene itself does not occur naturally, scientists and engineers are still learning how to isolate and manipulate individual layers of graphene. Some researchers have relied on the physical separation of the sheets, a process that can sometimes be as simple as peeling of sheets from crystalline graphite using Scotch tape. Other researchers have taken an ensemble approach, where they exploit the chemical conversion of graphite to the individual layers. The typical intermediary state is graphite oxide, which is often produced using strong oxidants under acidic conditions. Structurally, researchers hypothesize that acidic functional groups functionalize the oxidized material at the edges and a network of epoxy groups cover the sp(2)-bonded carbon network. The exfoliated material formed under these conditions can be used to form dispersions that are usually unstable. However, more importantly, irreversible defects form in the basal plane during oxidation and remain even after reduction of graphite oxide back to graphene-like material. As part of our interest in the dissolution of carbon nanomaterials, we have explored the derivatization of graphite following the same procedures that preserve the sp(2) bonding and the associated unique physical and electronic properties in the chemical processing of single-walled carbon nanotubes. In this Account, we describe efficient routes to exfoliate graphite either into graphitic nanoparticles or into graphene without resorting to oxidation. Our exfoliation process involves the intercalation of lithium into bulk graphite to yield graphene sheets reduced by the lithium. We can alkylate the resulting graphite salt reductively using solubilizing dodecyl groups. By probe microscopy, we show that these groups are attached covalently only at the graphitic edges.},

abstract = {Individual graphene oxide sheets subjected to chemical reduction were electrically characterized as a function of temperature and external electric fields. The fully reduced monolayers exhibited conductivities ranging between 0.05 and 2 S/cm and field effect mobilities of 2− 200 cm 2 /Vs at room temperature. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements and Raman spectroscopic investigations suggest that charge transport occurs via variable range hopping between intact graphene islands with sizes on the order of several nanometers. Furthermore, the comparative study of multilayered sheets revealed that the conductivity of the undermost layer is reduced by a factor of more than 2 as a consequence of the interaction with the Si/SiO 2 substrate. The peculiar electronic properties of graphene sheets have attracted strong interest both in the experimental and theoretical scientific community during the past few years. 1-3 Most prominently, carriers in an ideal graphene sheet behave as massless Dirac fermions. 4 In the meanwhile, these unique properties could be verified by a range of experiments,},

abstract = {This paper proposes a perfect energy source supplied by a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as a main power source and storage devices: battery and supercapacitor, for modern distributed generation system, particularly for future fuel cell vehicle applications. The energy in hybrid system is balanced by the dc bus voltage regulation. A supercapacitor module, as a high dynamic and high power density device, functions for supplying energy to regulate a dc bus voltage. A battery module, as a high energy density device, operates for supplying energy to a supercapacitor bank to keep it charged. A FC, as a slowest dynamic source in this system, functions to supply energy to a battery bank in order to keep it charged. Therefore, there are three voltage control loops: dc bus voltage regulated by a supercapacitor bank, supercapacitor voltage regulated by a battery bank, and battery voltage regulated by a FC. To authenticate the proposed control algorithm, a hardware system in our laboratory is realized by analog circuits and numerical calculation by dSPACE. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a PEMFC: 500-W, 50-A; a battery bank: 68-Ah, 24-V; and a supercapacitor bank: 292-F, 30-V, 500-A) corroborate the excellent control principle during motor drive cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The preparation of solution-processable graphene from graphite oxide typically involves a hydrazine reduction step, but the use of such a reagent in the large-scale implementation of this approach is not desirable due to its high toxicity. Here, we compare the deoxygenation efficiency of graphene oxide suspensions by different reductants (sodium borohydride, pyrogallol, and vitamin C, in addition to hydrazine), as well as by heating the suspensions under alkaline conditions. In almost all cases, the degree of reduction attainable and the subsequent restoration of relevant properties (e.g., electrical conductivity) lag significantly behind those achieved with hydrazine. Only vitamin C is found to yield highly reduced suspensions in a way comparable to those provided by hydrazine. Stable suspensions of vitamin C-reduced graphene oxide can be prepared not only in water but also in common organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). These results open the perspective of replacing hydrazine in the reduction of graphene oxide suspensions by an innocuous and safe reductant of similar efficacy, thus facilitating the use of graphene-based materials for large-scale applications.},

It provides a simple method to process the GO nanosheets into designed materials using it in aqueous solution, and with an electrochemical reduction to realise the functional graphene materials. This method avoids using graphene nanosheets as the feedstock which are difficult to dissolve in a solvent, especially at a high concentration. 1D fiber, two-dimensional thin film on glass or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (flat or curved), and 3D graphene sponge have been successfully prepared, and the dynamics of the reduction was also studied. Electrochemical reduction is especially suitable for reducing composites of GO and polymers, a process which can be carried out at room temperature without any chemical reducing agents. A silk fibroin/electrochemically reduced GO (SF/ERGO) composite film was prepared using homogeneous reduction, which showed excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity.

The cross-planar oxidation of graphite from the (0002) plane results in periodic cracking of the uppermost graphene oxide layer, limiting its lateral dimension to less than 30 $\mu$m. We use an energy balance between the elastic strain energy associated with the undulation of graphene oxide sheets at the hydroxyl and epoxy sites, the crack formation energy, and the interaction energy between graphene layers to determine the cell size of the cracks. As the effective crack propagation rate in the cross-planar direction is an order of magnitude smaller than the edge-to-center oxidation rate, graphene oxide single sheets larger than those defined by the periodic cracking cell size are produced depending on the aspect ratio of the graphite particles. We also demonstrate that external energy input from hydrodynamic drag created by fluid motion or sonication, further reduces the size of the graphene oxide sheets through tensile stress buildup in the sheets.},

These energy density values are comparable to that of the Ni metal hydride battery, but the supercapacitor can be charged or discharged in seconds or minutes. The key to success was the ability to make full utilization of the highest intrinsic surface capacitance and specific surface area of single-layer graphene by preparing curved graphene sheets that will not restack face-to-face.

Microscale supercapacitors have great potential to complement or replace batteries and electrolytic capacitors in a variety of applications. However, conventional micro-fabrication techniques have proven to be cumbersome in building cost-effective micro-devices, thus limiting their widespread application. Here we demonstrate a scalable fabrication of graphene micro-supercapacitors over large areas by direct laser writing on graphite oxide films using a standard LightScribe DVD burner. More than 100 micro-supercapacitors can be produced on a single disc in 30 min or less. The devices are built on flexible substrates for flexible electronics and on-chip uses that can be integrated with MEMS or CMOS in a single chip. Remarkably, miniaturizing the devices to the microscale results in enhanced charge-storage capacity and rate capability. These micro-supercapacitors demonstrate a power density of {\~{}}200 W cm-3, which is among the highest values achieved for any supercapacitor.},

abstract = {Graphite oxide (GO) is a lamellar substance with an ambiguous structure due to material complexity. Recently published GO-related studies employ only one out of several existing models to interpret the experimental data. Because the models are different, this leads to confusion in understanding the nature of the observed phenomena. Lessening the structural ambiguity would lead to further developments in functionalization and use of GO. Here, we show that the structure and properties of GO depend significantly on the quenching and purification procedures, rather than, as is commonly thought, on the type of graphite used or oxidation protocol. We introduce a new purification protocol that produces a product that we refer to as pristine GO (pGO) in contrast to the commonly known material that we will refer to as conventional GO (cGO). We explain the differences between pGO and cGO by transformations caused by reaction with water. We produce ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and scanning electron microscopic analytical evidence for the structure of pGO. This work provides a new explanation for the acidity of GO solutions and allows us to add critical details to existing GO models.},

abstract = {The functionalization of graphene provides diverse possibilities to improve the handling of graphene and enable further chemical transformation on graphene. Graphene functionalized with mainly heteroatom-based functional groups to enhance its chemical and physical properties is intensively pursued but often resulted in grafting of the heteroatoms as various functional groups. Here, we show that graphene oxide can be functionalized with predominantly a single type of sulfur moiety and reduced simultaneously to form monothiol-functionalized graphene. The thiol-functionalized graphene shows a high electrical conductivity and heterogeneous electron transfer rate. Graphene is also embedded with a trace amount of manganese impurities originating from a prior graphite oxidation process, which facilitates the thiol-functionalized graphene to function as a hybrid electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline medium with an onset potential lower than for Pt/C. Further characterizations of the graphene are performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This material contributes to the class of hybrids that are highly active electrocatalysts.},

abstract = {Large-scale (2kg/day) solution-based graphene was fabricated in a continuous pilot process. It was found that controlling the heat of solution, ??Hsoln, rather than that of the oxidation reaction, ??Hrxn, was crucial for safe operation because the heat-release rate of the dissolution of the oxidizer to sulfuric acid was higher than that of the oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide (GO). A small amount of water can also suppress the formation of the peroxide form that can cause an explosion. Three continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series were used to feed the graphite and oxidizer step by step with slightly diluted sulfuric acid solution. The main oxidation reaction requires more than 2h at 50??C for adequate oxidation when the Hummers method is used. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) prepared using the continuous thermal reduction equipment shows electrical conductivity of 600S/m and a BET surface area of 400-600m2/g, which were comparable to the values for RGOs fabricated using well-controlled laboratory scale procedures. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The electrical conductivity is treated with assumptions about the mean free path. It is found to be about 100 times as great parallel to as across crystal planes.

The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons.

abstract = {Shell-isolated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (shell-isolated SERS), where the isolating shell prevents metal−molecule interactions and improves the stability of the metal nanoparticles, has recently drawn a tremendous amount of attention. However, obtaining an ultrathin, seamless, and chemically stable isolating shell for shell-isolated SERS is still in its infancy. Graphene, with a high optical transparency and chemical inertness, is an ideal candidate to serve as an isolating shell. In the present work, graphene with a controlled number of layers is grown on the surface of metal nanoparticles via chemical vapor deposition, creating graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (M@G, where M = Cu, Ag, and Au) suitable for shell-isolated SERS. Ultraviolet−visible spectroscopy of Ag@G, Cu@G, and their corresponding nano- particles indicates that graphene can prevent the surface oxidation of Ag and Cu nanoparticles after exposure to ambient air, giving a SERS-active substrate with a long lifetime. The Raman spectra of cobalt phthalocyanine and rhodamine 6G on M@G substrates show that Au@G can dramatically suppress photobleaching and fluorescence of the probe molecules, resulting in an enhanced Raman signal. Hence, M@G is a promising material for applications in chemical and biological detection because of its long-term stability and superior SERS performance.},

abstract = {Chemical reduction of graphene oxide can be used to produce large quantities of reduced graphene oxide for potential application in electronics, optoelectronics, composite materials and energy-storage devices. Here we report a highly efficient one-pot reduction of graphene oxide using a sodium-ammonia solution as the reducing agent. The solvated electrons in sodium-ammonia solution can effectively facilitate the de-oxygenation of graphene oxide and the restoration of $\pi$-conjugation to produce reduced graphene oxide samples with an oxygen content of 5.6 wt{\%}. Electrical characterization of single reduced graphene oxide flakes demonstrates a high hole mobility of 123 cm(2) Vs(-1). In addition, we show that the pre-formed graphene oxide thin film can be directly reduced to form reduced graphene oxide film with a combined low sheet resistance ({\~{}}350 $\Omega$ per square with {\~{}}80{\%} transmittance). Our study demonstrates a new, low-temperature solution processing approach to high-quality graphene materials with lowest sheet resistance and highest carrier mobility.},

The energy density and power density of the supercapacitor reach 57.94 Wh kg-1 and 59.84 kW kg-1, respectively.

abstract = {We report the fabrication of graphene-encapsulated nanoballs with copper nanoparticle (Cu NP) cores whose size range from 40 nm to 1 $\mu$m using a solid carbon source of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The Cu NPs were prone to agglomerate during the annealing process at high temperatures of 800 to 900 °C when gas carbon source such as methane was used for the growth of graphene. On the contrary, the morphologies of the Cu NPs were unchanged during the growth of graphene at the same temperature range when PMMA coating was used. The solid source of PMMA was first converted to amorphous carbon layers through a pyrolysis process at the temperature regime of 400 °C, which prevented the Cu NPs from agglomeration, and they were converted to few-layered graphene (FLG) at the elevated temperatures. Raman and transmission electron microscope analyses confirmed the synthesis of FLG with thickness of approximately 3 nm directly on the surface of the Cu NPs. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, along with electrical resistance measurement according to temperature changes showed that the FLG-encapsulated Cu NPs were highly resistant to oxidation even after exposure to severe oxidation conditions.},

The breaking strength is 42 N m−1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite.

The reaction, performed at ambient conditions, yields surface adsorbed GMs structurally and electronically equivalent to those synthesized in solution. The new synthetic approach reduces the challenges associated with the tendency of GMs to aggregate and provides a convenient path for integration of GMs into optoelectronic applications. The surface synthesized GMs can be effectively reduced or oxidized via an interfacial charge transfer and can also function as sensitizers for metal oxides in light harvesting applications. Sensitized solar cells (SSCs) prepared from mesoscopic TiO2/GM films and an iodide-based liquid electrolyte show photocurrents of similar to 2.5 mA/cm(2), an open circuit voltage of similar to 0.55 V and fill factor of similar to 0.65 under AM 1.5 illumination. The observed power conversion efficiency of eta = 0.87{\%} is the highest reported efficiency for the GM sensitized solar cell. The performance of the devices was reproducible and stable for a period of at least 3 weeks.

Oxidation of graphite effectively facilitates the exfoliation process, yet necessitates several lengthy washing and reduction processes to convert the exfoliated graphite oxide (graphene oxide, GO) to reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Although filtration, centrifugation and dialysis have been frequently used in the washing stage, none of them is favorable for large-scale production. Here, we report the synthesis of RGO by sonication-assisted oxidation of graphite in a solution of potassium permanganate and concentrated sulfuric acid followed by reduction with ascorbic acid prior to any washing processes. GO loses its hydrophilicity during the reduction stage which facilitates the washing step and reduces the time required for production of RGO. Furthermore, simultaneous oxidation and exfoliation significantly enhance the yield of few-layer GO. We hope this one-pot and fully-scalable protocol paves the road toward out of lab applications of graphene.},

abstract = {Graphene is a two-dimensional crystalline carbon allotrope that has fascinated researchers worldwide and has extended the interest in carbon structures such as fullerenes and nanotubes. In this Account, we use electrical characterization tools to study chemistry on supported graphene. These experiments elucidate the way covalently bound phenyl units can change graphene's physical properties. Can we use chemistry to control electronic properties of graphene? What can we learn from well-known carbon allotropes like fullerenes? The surfaces of fullerenes and graphene show distinct differences in reactivity because of the high strain of sp² carbon in fullerenes compared with the complete lack of strain in graphene. Diazonium chemistry provides a versatile tool for attaching phenyl units covalently to carbon to produce advanced materials and electronic components, but diazonium-based carbon chemistry is strongly influenced by strain. Although fullerenes are highly reactive, graphite (stacks of graphene) remains relatively inert. We chemically introduce n- and p-like doping patterns in two-dimensional graphene using photolithography and extend the ability to chemically control doping to the chemical design of conducting and insulating areas. Thereby we can shape graphene surfaces into functional electronic devices. This Account also describes multistep synthesis on graphene-coated nanoparticles and the introduction of various functional groups on graphene surfaces. Only few functional groups can be produced directly via diazonium chemistry. To overcome this issue, we used these functional groups as starting points for more demanding organic reactions. We covalently attached chelating agents, catalysts, or polymers on the carbon surface. These more complex reactions facilitate the design of electronic modifications, intergraphene connections, and anchors for polymer incorporation. Diazonium chemistry forms strong covalent bridges between graphene and other areas of chemistry.},

abstract = {Graphene consists of a monolayer of sp(2) bonded carbon atoms and has attracted considerable interest over recent years due to its extreme mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Graphene nanocomposites have naturally begun to be studied to capitalize upon these properties. A range of complex chemical and physical processing methods have been devised that achieve isolated graphene sheets that attempt to prevent aggregation. Here we demonstrate that the simple casting of a polymer solution containing dispersed graphene oxide, followed by thermal reduction, can produce well-isolated monolayer reduced-graphene oxide. The presence of single layer reduced-graphene oxide is quantitatively demonstrated through transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction studies and the reduction is verified by thermogravimetric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectrum, and electrical conductivity studies. These findings provide a simple, environmentally benign and commercially viable process to produce reduced-graphene oxide reinforced polymers without complex manufacturing, dispersion or reduction processes.},

abstract = {Aerogels are used in a broad range of scientific and industrial applications due to their large surface areas, ultrafine pore sizes, and extremely low densities. Recently, a large number of reports have described graphene aerogels based on the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Though these GO-based aerogels represent a considerable advance relative to traditional carbon aerogels, they remain significantly inferior to individual graphene sheets due to their poor crystallinity. Here, we report a straightforward method to synthesize highly crystalline GO-based graphene aerogels via high-temperature processing common in commercial graphite production. The crystallization of the graphene aerogels versus annealing temperature is characterized using Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. Nitrogen porosimetry shows that the highly crystalline graphene macrostructure maintains a high surface area and ultrafine pore size. Because of their enhanced crystallinity, these graphene aerogels exhibit a ∼200 °C improvement in oxidation temperature and an order of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity.},

The room temperature values of the thermal conductivity in the range ∼(4.84 (0.44) × 10 3 to (5.30 (0.48) × 10 3 W/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and independently measured G peak temperature coefficient. The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction. The superb thermal conduction property of graphene is beneficial for the proposed electronic applications and establishes graphene as an excellent material for thermal management. Graphene, a recently discovered form of carbon 1 that consists of only one plain layer of atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, exhibits a number of intriguing properties. 1–8 The unusual energy dispersion relation, the low-lying electrons in single-layer graphene behave like massless relativistic Dirac fermions, gives rise to unique phenomena such as quantum spin Hall effect, 2,3 enhanced Coulomb interaction,},

Due to the excellent NIR light absorption properties of the reduced graphene oxide coated gold nanorods (r-GO-AuNRs) and highly efficient heat transfer process through the reduced graphene oxide layer, r-GO-AuNRs exhibit excellent photothermal stability and significantly higher photoacoustic amplitudes than those of bare-AuNRs, nonreduced graphene oxide coated AuNRs (GO-AuNRs), or silica-coated AuNR, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo systems. The linear response of PA amplitude from reduced state controlled GO on AuNR indicates the critical role of GO for a strong photothermal effect of r-GO-AuNRs. Theoretical studies with finite-element-method lab-based simulation reveal that a 4 times higher magnitude of the enhanced electromagnetic field around r-GO-AuNRs can be generated compared with bare AuNRs or GO-AuNRs. Furthermore, the r-GO-AuNRs are expected to be a promising deep-tissue imaging probe because of extraordinarily high PA amplitudes in the 4-11 MHz operating frequency of an ultrasound transducer. Therefore, the r-GO-AuNRs can be a useful imaging probe for highly sensitive photoacoustic images and NIR sensitive therapeutics based on a strong photothermal effect.},

The morphology of GSCR was studied by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The dispersion behavior of the GSCR composite was also studied in 18 different solvents, and the digital images indicate that it is soluble both in water and in a variety of organic solvents. The GSCR nanosheets are still single layers or bilayers in water and individual from one to another after 100 days of storage. Furthermore, the mechanism of GSCR's good solubility was successfully explained by the Hansen solubility parameters. The four standard probe result shows that the GSCR films have a bulk conductivity of approximately 6850 S m(-1). The wide solubility and long lifetime of GSCR solutions are absolutely necessary for further treatment.

Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO(4), NaNO(3), H(2)SO(4)) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO(3), increasing the amount of KMnO(4), and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H(2)SO(4)/H(3)PO(4) improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO(4). Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.},

During the past few years various institutions came up with suggestions for a definition, leading to a recommendation of the EU commission, which finally is being accepted into new and existing EU legislation.

abstract = {The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity. The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects, which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.},

Graphene has high mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability. So far, the main focus has been on fundamental physics and electronic devices. However, we believe its true potential to be in photonics and optoelectronics, where the combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the Dirac electrons enables ultra-wide-band tunability. The rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from solar cells and light emitting devices, to touch screens, photodetectors and ultrafast lasers.

abstract = {Graphene and its derivatives are versatile building blocks for bottom-up assembly of advanced functional materials. In particular, with exceptionally large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and superior chemical/electrochemical stability, graphene represents the ideal material for various electrochemical energy storage devices including supercapacitors. However, due to the strong $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between graphene sheets, the graphene flakes tend to restack to form graphite-like powders when they are processed into practical electrode materials, which can greatly reduce the specific surface area and lead to inefficient utilization of the graphene layers for electrochemical energy storage. The self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene sheets into three-dimensional (3D) framework structures can largely retain the unique properties of individual graphene sheets and has recently garnered intense interest for fundamental investigations and potential applications in diverse technologies. In this Account, we review the recent advances in preparing 3D graphene macrostructures and exploring them as a unique platform for supercapacitor applications. We first describe the synthetic strategies, in which reduction of a graphene oxide dispersion above a certain critical concentration can induce the reduced graphene oxide sheets to cross-link with each other via partial $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking interactions to form a 3D interconnected porous macrostructure. Multiple reduction strategies, including hydrothermal/solvothermal reduction, chemical reduction, and electrochemical reduction, have been developed for the preparation of 3D graphene macrostructures. The versatile synthetic strategies allow for easy incorporation of heteroatoms, carbon nanomaterials, functional polymers, and inorganic nanostructures into the macrostructures to yield diverse composites with tailored structures and properties. We then summarize the applications of the 3D graphene macrostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. With a unique framework structure in which the graphene sheets are interlocked in 3D space to prevent their restacking, the graphene macrostructures feature very high specific surface areas, rapid electron and ion transport, and superior mechanical strength. They can thus be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes with excellent specific capacitances, rate capabilities, and cycling stabilities. We finally discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in this research field. By regarding the graphene as both a single-atom-thick carbon sheet and a conjugated macromolecule, our work opens a new avenue to bottom-up self-assembly of graphene macromolecule sheets into functional 3D graphene macrostructures with remarkable electrochemical performances. We hope that this Account will promote further efforts toward fundamental investigation of graphene self-assembly and the development of advanced 3D graphene materials for their real-world applications in electrochemical energy storage devices and beyond.},

abstract = {ab stra ct A considerable amount of research has been devoted to the synthesis of graphene materials via graphene oxide (GO) precursor during recent years due to the fact that it is ease in processing, versatile, and scal- able for mass production. Nevertheless, GO needs to be reduced in order to recover the unique properties of pristine graphene. Of the various reduction approaches, the electrochemical method provides a facile, fast, scalable, economic and environmentally benign pathway to the production of desirable quality graphene materials. The electrochemical approach can be undertaken via two different routes: the one-step route which involves direct electrochemical reduction of GO in suspension onto the substrate electrode whereas the two-step route requires pre-deposition of GO onto the substrate electrode prior to electrochemical reduction process. This paper first reviews the preparation methods and various prop- erties of graphene oxide. This is followed by a discussion on the working parameters of the two different electrochemical routes and the associated electrochemical techniques used to produce graphene. This paper also provides reviews on the characteristic properties of the electrochemically reduced graphene through the analysis of various spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic.},

In the standardized process, 10-2M silver nitrate solution was interacted for 4h with lemon juice (2{\%} citric acid concentration and 0.5{\%} ascorbic acid concentration) in the ratio of 1:4 (vol:vol). The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance as determined by UV-Visible spectra in the range of 400-500nm.

abstract = {After the pioneering investigations into graphene-based electronics at Georgia Tech, great strides have been made developing epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (EG) as a new electronic material. EG has not only demonstrated its potential for large scale applications, it also has become an important material for fundamental two-dimensional electron gas physics. It was long known that graphene mono and multilayers grow on SiC crystals at high temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum. At these temperatures, silicon sublimes from the surface and the carbon rich surface layer transforms to graphene. However the quality of the graphene produced in ultrahigh vacuum is poor due to the high sublimation rates at relatively low temperatures. The Georgia Tech team developed growth methods involving encapsulating the SiC crystals in graphite enclosures, thereby sequestering the evaporated silicon and bringing growth process closer to equilibrium. In this confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) process, very high-quality graphene is grown on both polar faces of the SiC crystals. Since 2003, over 50 publications used CCS grown graphene, where it is known as the "furnace grown" graphene. Graphene multilayers grown on the carbon-terminated face of SiC, using the CCS method, were shown to consist of decoupled high mobility graphene layers. The CCS method is now applied on structured silicon carbide surfaces to produce high mobility nano-patterned graphene structures thereby demonstrating that EG is a viable contender for next-generation electronics. Here we present for the first time the CCS method that outperforms other epitaxial graphene production methods.},

abstract = {Graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites were prepared by using TiCl(3) and graphene oxide as reactants. The concentration of graphene oxide in starting solution played an important role in photoelectronic and photocatalytic performance of graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites. Either a p-type or n-type semiconductor was formed by graphene oxide in graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites. These semiconductors could be excited by visible light with wavelengths longer than 510 nm and acted as sensitizer in graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites. Visible-light driven photocatalytic performance of graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites in degradation of methyl orange was also studied. Crystalline quality and chemical states of carbon elements from graphene oxide in graphene oxide/TiO(2) composites depended on the concentration of graphene oxide in the starting solution. This study shows a possible way to fabricate graphene oxide/semiconductor composites with different properties by using a tunable semiconductor conductivity type of graphene oxide.},

The first edition of this book has nurtured numerous beginners and experts since 1993. The second edition includes a number of new developments in the field. Non-contact atomic-force microscopy has demonstrated true atomic resolution. It enables direct observation and mapping of individual chemical bonds. A new chapter about the underlying physics, atomic forces, is added. The chapter on atomic force microscopy is substantially expanded. Spin-polarized STM has enabled the observation of local magnetic phenomena down to atomic scale. A pedagogical presentation of the basic concepts is included. Inelastic scanning tunneling microscopy has shown the capability of studying vibrational modes of individual molecules. The underlying theory and new instrumentation are added. For biological research, to increase the speed of scanning to observe life phenomena in real time is a key. Advanced in this direction is presented as well. The capability of STM to manipulate individual atoms is one of the cornerstones of nanotechnology. The theoretical basis and in particular the relation between tunneling and interaction energy are thoroughly presented, together with experimental facts.},

abstract = {Exfoliation, i.e. individual separation of carbon sheets, is of great interest to produce single-layered graphene nanosheets. Chemical or thermal treatments are popular approaches to exfoliate graphite chunks. In general, these conventional methods are assisted with intercalation via covalent or non-covalent functionalization, expansion, and swelling, adsorption of organic molecules in gas phase, solid nanoparticle insertion or direct molecular exfoliation. However, direct covalent modification of graphene is challenging and the zero-band gap of graphene limits its use in field-effect transistors in nanoelectronics. Therefore, the use of a band-gap tunable p-type semiconducting reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is an alternative route. There are several approaches to tune its band gap, including tailoring the chemistry. Critical parameters include the control of oxygen amount determined by the degree and time of oxidation and reduction conditions (e. g. temperature), often leading to nonstoichiometry. This short review therefore highlights the production of rGO focusing primarily on the effect of thermal treatmenton the nature and the role of oxygen during thermal exfoliation of GO. The impact of oxygen functionalization on the modulation of the band gap is also reviewed for chemically and thermally reduced GO, as well as chemically treated rGO followed by a thermal exfoliation.},

A one-step solvothermal method featuring the reduction of graphene oxide and formation of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles was efficient, scalable, green, and controllable. The composite nanosheet was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which demonstrated that CuFe2O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm were densely and compactly deposited on GN. To investigate the formation mechanism of CuFe2O4-GN, we discussed in detail the effects of a series of experimental parameters, including the concentrations of the precursor, precipitation agent, stabilizer agent, and graphene oxide on the size and morphology of the resulting products. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the CuFe2O4-GN composite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The composite showed high electrochemical capacitance (576.6 F{\textperiodcentered}g-1 at 1 A{\textperiodcentered}g-1), good rate performance, and cycling stability. These results demonstrated that the composite, as a kind of electrode materials, had a high specific capacitance and good retention. The versatile CuFe2O4-GN holds great promise for application in a wide range of electrochemical fields because of the remarkable synergistic effects between CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and graphene. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Graphene can be viewed as an individual atomic plane extracted from graphite, as unrolled single-walled carbon nanotube or as an extended flat fullerene molecule. In this paper, a facile approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets in large scale through electrochemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide precursor at cathodic potentials (completely reduced potential:1.5 V) is reported. This method is green and fast, and will not result in contamination of the reduced material. The electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques in comparison to the chemically reduced graphene-based product. Particularly, FTIR spectra indicate that a variety of the oxygen-containing functional groups have been thoroughly removed from the graphite oxide plane via electrochemical reduction. The chemically converted materials are not expected to exhibit graphene's electronic properties because of residual defects. Indeed, the high quality graphene accelerates the electron transfer rate in dopamine electrochemistry (Ep is as small as 44 mV which is much smaller than that on a glassy carbon electrode). This approach opens up the possibility for assembling graphene biocomposites for electrocatalysis and the construction of biosensors},

abstract = {Electrical contact materials with excellent performances are crucial for the development and safe use of electrical contacts in different applications. In our work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/copper (Cu) composite films, as potential electrical contact materials, have been synthesized on copper foil with one-step electrochemical reduction deposition method. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to define the deposition conditions, and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the chemical compositions, molecular and micro- and nano-structures of the composite films. Atomic force microscopy/scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (AFM/SKPFM), conductive AFM (C-AFM) as well as impedance analysis were employed to evaluate the electroactive/electrical properties of the prepared composite films, respectively. The CRM and XPS results suggest that the rGO/Cu composite films can be synthesized through one-step electrochemical codeposition using suitable precursor solutions. Within a short deposition period, the growth of discrete nanograins in the composite film predominates, whereas pine-tree-leaf nanostructures are formed in the composite film when the deposition period is long, due to the chelating role of GO or rGO to regulate the growth rate of metallic copper nanograins. The electrical resistivity of the composite films is lower than the polished Cu foil and the electrodeposited Cu film, probably due to the higher conductivity (enhanced transfer of charge carriers) of the rGO incorporated in the composite films. The Volta potential variation in the rGO/Cu composite film is quite different from that in the electrodeposited Cu film. The electroactivity of the rGO/Cu composite films is higher than the electrodeposited Cu film, but lower than polished Cu foil, and the underlying mechanisms have been discussed.},

Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,...) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects.

abstract = {This chapter describes the ´squalenoylation´ technology, a platform for the discovery of newnanomedicines. The design of nanomedicines is generally based on the physical encapsulation, adsorption, or entrapment of a drug in a nanocarrier. This generally results in poor drug loading, and often an uncontrolled fast release of the drug (known as burst release). To overcome those limitations, the squalenoylation concept is based onthe chemical (rather than physical) loading of drugs in nanomedicines. The idea is to link a biologically active compound (anticancer, antibiotic, antiviral, MRI imaging agent, etc.) to squalene, a natural and biocompatible lipid. Due to the unique, dynamically folded molecular conformation of squalene, the resulting squalene-drug bioconjugates self-assemble spontaneously in water to form nanoparticles. The resulting nanoassemblies havebeen shown to have enhanced pharmacological activity, and with reduced toxicity, thus paving the way to a new concept in the field of drug delivery.},

Transistors showed the hole and electron mobilities of the device of 1100 +/- 70 and 550 +/- 50 cm(2)/(V s) at drain bias of -0.75 V, respectively. The piezo-resistance gauge factor of strain sensor was approximately 6.1. These methods represent a significant step toward the realization of graphene devices in wafer scale as well as application in optoelectronics, flexible and stretchable electronics.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated a facile and efficient strategy for the fabrication of soluble reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO) and the preparation of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticle-RGO composites using a modified one-step hydrothermal method. It was found that graphene oxide could be easily reduced under solvothermal conditions with ascorbic acid as reductant, with concomitant growth of TiO2 particles on the RGO surface. The TiO2-RGO composite has been thoroughly characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Microscopy techniques (scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy) have been employed to probe the morphological characteristics as well as to investigate the exfoliation of RGO sheets. The TiO2-RGO composite exhibited excellent photocatalysis of hydrogen evolution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {An improved Hummers method without using NaNO3 can produce graphene oxide nearly the same to that prepared by conventional Hummers method. This modification does not decrease the yield of product, eliminating the evolution of NO2/N2O4 toxic gasses and simplifying the disposal of waste water because of the inexistence of Na + and NO3- ions. For the first time, we also developed a prototype method of post-treating the waste water collected from the systems of synthesizing and purifying graphene oxide. The content of Mn 2+ ions in the purified waste water was measured to be lower than the guideline value for drinking water. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
