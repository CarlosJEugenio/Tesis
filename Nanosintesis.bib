Suspension ???150??nm above a Si/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a perfect energy source supplied by a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as a main power source and storage devices: battery and supercapacitor, for modern distributed generation system, particularly for future fuel cell vehicle applications. The energy in hybrid system is balanced by the dc bus voltage regulation. A supercapacitor module, as a high dynamic and high power density device, functions for supplying energy to regulate a dc bus voltage. A battery module, as a high energy density device, operates for supplying energy to a supercapacitor bank to keep it charged. A FC, as a slowest dynamic source in this system, functions to supply energy to a battery bank in order to keep it charged. Therefore, there are three voltage control loops: dc bus voltage regulated by a supercapacitor bank, supercapacitor voltage regulated by a battery bank, and battery voltage regulated by a FC. To authenticate the proposed control algorithm, a hardware system in our laboratory is realized by analog circuits and numerical calculation by dSPACE. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a PEMFC: 500-W, 50-A; a battery bank: 68-Ah, 24-V; and a supercapacitor bank: 292-F, 30-V, 500-A) corroborate the excellent control principle during motor drive cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present a method for preparation of graphene molecules (GMs), whereby a polyphenylene precursor functionalized with surface anchoring groups, preadsorbed on surface of TiO2, is oxidatively dehydrogenated in situ via a Scholl reaction. The reaction, performed at ambient conditions, yields surface adsorbed GMs structurally and electronically equivalent to those synthesized in solution. The new synthetic approach reduces the challenges associated with the tendency of GMs to aggregate and provides a convenient path for integration of GMs into optoelectronic applications. The surface synthesized GMs can be effectively reduced or oxidized via an interfacial charge transfer and can also function as sensitizers for metal oxides in light harvesting applications. Sensitized solar cells (SSCs) prepared from mesoscopic TiO2/GM films and an iodide-based liquid electrolyte show photocurrents of similar to 2.5 mA/cm(2), an open circuit voltage of similar to 0.55 V and fill factor of similar to 0.65 under AM 1.5 illumination. The observed power conversion efficiency of eta = 0.87{\%} is the highest reported efficiency for the GM sensitized solar cell. The performance of the devices was reproducible and stable for a period of at least 3 weeks. We also report first external and internal quantum efficiency measurements for GM SSCs, which point to possible paths for further performance improvements.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of the oxidation path and the mechanical energy input on the size of graphene oxide sheets derived from graphite oxide. The cross-planar oxidation of graphite from the (0002) plane results in periodic cracking of the uppermost graphene oxide layer, limiting its lateral dimension to less than 30 $\mu$m. We use an energy balance between the elastic strain energy associated with the undulation of graphene oxide sheets at the hydroxyl and epoxy sites, the crack formation energy, and the interaction energy between graphene layers to determine the cell size of the cracks. As the effective crack propagation rate in the cross-planar direction is an order of magnitude smaller than the edge-to-center oxidation rate, graphene oxide single sheets larger than those defined by the periodic cracking cell size are produced depending on the aspect ratio of the graphite particles. We also demonstrate that external energy input from hydrodynamic drag created by fluid motion or sonication, further reduces the size of the graphene oxide sheets through tensile stress buildup in the sheets.},

abstract = {An improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is described. Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO(4), NaNO(3), H(2)SO(4)) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO(3), increasing the amount of KMnO(4), and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H(2)SO(4)/H(3)PO(4) improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO(4). Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.},

Due to the excellent NIR light absorption properties of the reduced graphene oxide coated gold nanorods (r-GO-AuNRs) and highly efficient heat transfer process through the reduced graphene oxide layer, r-GO-AuNRs exhibit excellent photothermal stability and significantly higher photoacoustic amplitudes than those of bare-AuNRs, nonreduced graphene oxide coated AuNRs (GO-AuNRs), or silica-coated AuNR, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo systems. The linear response of PA amplitude from reduced state controlled GO on AuNR indicates the critical role of GO for a strong photothermal effect of r-GO-AuNRs. Theoretical studies with finite-element-method lab-based simulation reveal that a 4 times higher magnitude of the enhanced electromagnetic field around r-GO-AuNRs can be generated compared with bare AuNRs or GO-AuNRs. Furthermore, the r-GO-AuNRs are expected to be a promising deep-tissue imaging probe because of extraordinarily high PA amplitudes in the 4-11 MHz operating frequency of an ultrasound transducer. Therefore, the r-GO-AuNRs can be a useful imaging probe for highly sensitive photoacoustic images and NIR sensitive therapeutics based on a strong photothermal effect.},

However, we believe its true potential to be in photonics and optoelectronics, where the combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the Dirac electrons enables ultra-wide-band tunability. The rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from solar cells and light emitting devices, to touch screens, photodetectors and ultrafast lasers. Here we review the state of the art in this emerging field.},

abstract = {Because of graphene's anticipated applications in electronics and its thermal, mechanical, and optical properties, many scientists and engineers are interested in this material. Graphene is an isolated layer of the $\pi$-stacked hexagonal allotrope of carbon known as graphite. The interlayer cohesive energy of graphite, or exfoliation energy, that results from van der Waals attractions over the interlayer spacing distance of 3.34 {\AA} (61 meV/C atom) is many times weaker than the intralayer covalent bonding. Since graphene itself does not occur naturally, scientists and engineers are still learning how to isolate and manipulate individual layers of graphene. Some researchers have relied on the physical separation of the sheets, a process that can sometimes be as simple as peeling of sheets from crystalline graphite using Scotch tape. Other researchers have taken an ensemble approach, where they exploit the chemical conversion of graphite to the individual layers. The typical intermediary state is graphite oxide, which is often produced using strong oxidants under acidic conditions. Structurally, researchers hypothesize that acidic functional groups functionalize the oxidized material at the edges and a network of epoxy groups cover the sp(2)-bonded carbon network. The exfoliated material formed under these conditions can be used to form dispersions that are usually unstable. However, more importantly, irreversible defects form in the basal plane during oxidation and remain even after reduction of graphite oxide back to graphene-like material. As part of our interest in the dissolution of carbon nanomaterials, we have explored the derivatization of graphite following the same procedures that preserve the sp(2) bonding and the associated unique physical and electronic properties in the chemical processing of single-walled carbon nanotubes. In this Account, we describe efficient routes to exfoliate graphite either into graphitic nanoparticles or into graphene without resorting to oxidation. Our exfoliation process involves the intercalation of lithium into bulk graphite to yield graphene sheets reduced by the lithium. We can alkylate the resulting graphite salt reductively using solubilizing dodecyl groups. By probe microscopy, we show that these groups are attached covalently only at the graphitic edges.},

Different types of capacitors with a pure electrostatic attraction and/or pseudocapacitance effects are presented. Their performance in various electrolytes is studied taking into account the different range of operating voltage (1 V for aqueous and 3 V for aprotic solutions). Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,...) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects. Evaluation of capacitor performance by different techniques, e.g. voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, charge/discharge characteristics is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity. The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects, which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.},

abstract = {The functionalization of graphene provides diverse possibilities to improve the handling of graphene and enable further chemical transformation on graphene. Graphene functionalized with mainly heteroatom-based functional groups to enhance its chemical and physical properties is intensively pursued but often resulted in grafting of the heteroatoms as various functional groups. Here, we show that graphene oxide can be functionalized with predominantly a single type of sulfur moiety and reduced simultaneously to form monothiol-functionalized graphene. The thiol-functionalized graphene shows a high electrical conductivity and heterogeneous electron transfer rate. Graphene is also embedded with a trace amount of manganese impurities originating from a prior graphite oxidation process, which facilitates the thiol-functionalized graphene to function as a hybrid electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline medium with an onset potential lower than for Pt/C. Further characterizations of the graphene are performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

abstract = {Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms.

abstract = {An improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is described. Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO(4), NaNO(3), H(2)SO(4)) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO(3), increasing the amount of KMnO(4), and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H(2)SO(4)/H(3)PO(4) improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO(4). Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.},

abstract = {Shell-isolated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (shell-isolated SERS), where the isolating shell prevents metal−molecule interactions and improves the stability of the metal nanoparticles, has recently drawn a tremendous amount of attention. However, obtaining an ultrathin, seamless, and chemically stable isolating shell for shell-isolated SERS is still in its infancy. Graphene, with a high optical transparency and chemical inertness, is an ideal candidate to serve as an isolating shell. In the present work, graphene with a controlled number of layers is grown on the surface of metal nanoparticles via chemical vapor deposition, creating graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (M@G, where M = Cu, Ag, and Au) suitable for shell-isolated SERS. Ultraviolet−visible spectroscopy of Ag@G, Cu@G, and their corresponding nano- particles indicates that graphene can prevent the surface oxidation of Ag and Cu nanoparticles after exposure to ambient air, giving a SERS-active substrate with a long lifetime. The Raman spectra of cobalt phthalocyanine and rhodamine 6G on M@G substrates show that Au@G can dramatically suppress photobleaching and fluorescence of the probe molecules, resulting in an enhanced Raman signal. Hence, M@G is a promising material for applications in chemical and biological detection because of its long-term stability and superior SERS performance.},

Here, we cover a portion of the recent progress toward using chemical techniques to render graphene available for incorporation into electronic and optical devices. With top-down and bottom-up strategies, the geometry and thickness of graphene have been well-tuned. The methods for producing structure-doped materials, such as nitrogen doping and h-BNC hybrid structures, are discussed along with the properties of those doped materials.

The devices are built on flexible substrates for flexible electronics and on-chip uses that can be integrated with MEMS or CMOS in a single chip. Remarkably, miniaturizing the devices to the microscale results in enhanced charge-storage capacity and rate capability.

abstract = {ab stra ct A considerable amount of research has been devoted to the synthesis of graphene materials via graphene oxide (GO) precursor during recent years due to the fact that it is ease in processing, versatile, and scal- able for mass production. Nevertheless, GO needs to be reduced in order to recover the unique properties of pristine graphene. Of the various reduction approaches, the electrochemical method provides a facile, fast, scalable, economic and environmentally benign pathway to the production of desirable quality graphene materials. The electrochemical approach can be undertaken via two different routes: the one-step route which involves direct electrochemical reduction of GO in suspension onto the substrate electrode whereas the two-step route requires pre-deposition of GO onto the substrate electrode prior to electrochemical reduction process. This paper first reviews the preparation methods and various prop- erties of graphene oxide. This is followed by a discussion on the working parameters of the two different electrochemical routes and the associated electrochemical techniques used to produce graphene. This paper also provides reviews on the characteristic properties of the electrochemically reduced graphene through the analysis of various spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic.},

abstract = {The preparation of solution-processable graphene from graphite oxide typically involves a hydrazine reduction step, but the use of such a reagent in the large-scale implementation of this approach is not desirable due to its high toxicity. Here, we compare the deoxygenation efficiency of graphene oxide suspensions by different reductants (sodium borohydride, pyrogallol, and vitamin C, in addition to hydrazine), as well as by heating the suspensions under alkaline conditions. In almost all cases, the degree of reduction attainable and the subsequent restoration of relevant properties (e.g., electrical conductivity) lag significantly behind those achieved with hydrazine. Only vitamin C is found to yield highly reduced suspensions in a way comparable to those provided by hydrazine. Stable suspensions of vitamin C-reduced graphene oxide can be prepared not only in water but also in common organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). These results open the perspective of replacing hydrazine in the reduction of graphene oxide suspensions by an innocuous and safe reductant of similar efficacy, thus facilitating the use of graphene-based materials for large-scale applications.},

abstract = {Exfoliation, i.e. individual separation of carbon sheets, is of great interest to produce single-layered graphene nanosheets. Chemical or thermal treatments are popular approaches to exfoliate graphite chunks. In general, these conventional methods are assisted with intercalation via covalent or non-covalent functionalization, expansion, and swelling, adsorption of organic molecules in gas phase, solid nanoparticle insertion or direct molecular exfoliation. However, direct covalent modification of graphene is challenging and the zero-band gap of graphene limits its use in field-effect transistors in nanoelectronics. Therefore, the use of a band-gap tunable p-type semiconducting reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is an alternative route. There are several approaches to tune its band gap, including tailoring the chemistry. Critical parameters include the control of oxygen amount determined by the degree and time of oxidation and reduction conditions (e. g. temperature), often leading to nonstoichiometry. This short review therefore highlights the production of rGO focusing primarily on the effect of thermal treatmenton the nature and the role of oxygen during thermal exfoliation of GO. The impact of oxygen functionalization on the modulation of the band gap is also reviewed for chemically and thermally reduced GO, as well as chemically treated rGO followed by a thermal exfoliation.},

abstract = {We prepared hydrazine-reduced materials from both graphite oxide (GO) particles, which were not exfoliated, and completely exfoliated individual graphene oxide platelets, and then analyzed their chemical and structural properties by elemental analysis, XPS, TGA, XRD, and SEM. Both reduced materials showed distinctly different chemical and structural properties from one another. While hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide platelets produced agglomerates of exfoliated platelets, the reduction of GO particles produced particles that were not exfoliated. The degree of chemical reduction of reduced GO particles was lower than that of reduced graphene oxide and the BET surface area of reduced GO was much lower than that of reduced graphene oxide. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Graphite oxide (GO) is a lamellar substance with an ambiguous structure due to material complexity. Recently published GO-related studies employ only one out of several existing models to interpret the experimental data. Because the models are different, this leads to confusion in understanding the nature of the observed phenomena. Lessening the structural ambiguity would lead to further developments in functionalization and use of GO. Here, we show that the structure and properties of GO depend significantly on the quenching and purification procedures, rather than, as is commonly thought, on the type of graphite used or oxidation protocol. We introduce a new purification protocol that produces a product that we refer to as pristine GO (pGO) in contrast to the commonly known material that we will refer to as conventional GO (cGO). We explain the differences between pGO and cGO by transformations caused by reaction with water. We produce ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and scanning electron microscopic analytical evidence for the structure of pGO. This work provides a new explanation for the acidity of GO solutions and allows us to add critical details to existing GO models.},

Graphene nanocomposites have naturally begun to be studied to capitalize upon these properties. A range of complex chemical and physical processing methods have been devised that achieve isolated graphene sheets that attempt to prevent aggregation. Here we demonstrate that the simple casting of a polymer solution containing dispersed graphene oxide, followed by thermal reduction, can produce well-isolated monolayer reduced-graphene oxide. The presence of single layer reduced-graphene oxide is quantitatively demonstrated through transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction studies and the reduction is verified by thermogravimetric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectrum, and electrical conductivity studies. These findings provide a simple, environmentally benign and commercially viable process to produce reduced-graphene oxide reinforced polymers without complex manufacturing, dispersion or reduction processes.},

The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction. The superb thermal conduction property of graphene is beneficial for the proposed electronic applications and establishes graphene as an excellent material for thermal management.

The dispersion behavior of the GSCR composite was also studied in 18 different solvents, and the digital images indicate that it is soluble both in water and in a variety of organic solvents. The GSCR nanosheets are still single layers or bilayers in water and individual from one to another after 100 days of storage. Furthermore, the mechanism of GSCR's good solubility was successfully explained by the Hansen solubility parameters. The four standard probe result shows that the GSCR films have a bulk conductivity of approximately 6850 S m(-1). The wide solubility and long lifetime of GSCR solutions are absolutely necessary for further treatment.

abstract = {Electrical contact materials with excellent performances are crucial for the development and safe use of electrical contacts in different applications. In our work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/copper (Cu) composite films, as potential electrical contact materials, have been synthesized on copper foil with one-step electrochemical reduction deposition method. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to define the deposition conditions, and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the chemical compositions, molecular and micro- and nano-structures of the composite films. Atomic force microscopy/scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (AFM/SKPFM), conductive AFM (C-AFM) as well as impedance analysis were employed to evaluate the electroactive/electrical properties of the prepared composite films, respectively. The CRM and XPS results suggest that the rGO/Cu composite films can be synthesized through one-step electrochemical codeposition using suitable precursor solutions. Within a short deposition period, the growth of discrete nanograins in the composite film predominates, whereas pine-tree-leaf nanostructures are formed in the composite film when the deposition period is long, due to the chelating role of GO or rGO to regulate the growth rate of metallic copper nanograins. The electrical resistivity of the composite films is lower than the polished Cu foil and the electrodeposited Cu film, probably due to the higher conductivity (enhanced transfer of charge carriers) of the rGO incorporated in the composite films. The Volta potential variation in the rGO/Cu composite film is quite different from that in the electrodeposited Cu film. The electroactivity of the rGO/Cu composite films is higher than the electrodeposited Cu film, but lower than polished Cu foil, and the underlying mechanisms have been discussed.},

In this paper, a facile approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets in large scale through electrochemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide precursor at cathodic potentials (completely reduced potential:1.5 V) is reported. This method is green and fast, and will not result in contamination of the reduced material. The electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques in comparison to the chemically reduced graphene-based product. Particularly, FTIR spectra indicate that a variety of the oxygen-containing functional groups have been thoroughly removed from the graphite oxide plane via electrochemical reduction. The chemically converted materials are not expected to exhibit graphene's electronic properties because of residual defects. Indeed, the high quality graphene accelerates the electron transfer rate in dopamine electrochemistry (Ep is as small as 44 mV which is much smaller than that on a glassy carbon electrode). This approach opens up the possibility for assembling graphene biocomposites for electrocatalysis and the construction of biosensors},

Here, we report a straightforward method to synthesize highly crystalline GO-based graphene aerogels via high-temperature processing common in commercial graphite production. The crystallization of the graphene aerogels versus annealing temperature is characterized using Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. Nitrogen porosimetry shows that the highly crystalline graphene macrostructure maintains a high surface area and ultrafine pore size.

abstract = {Graphene is a two-dimensional crystalline carbon allotrope that has fascinated researchers worldwide and has extended the interest in carbon structures such as fullerenes and nanotubes. In this Account, we use electrical characterization tools to study chemistry on supported graphene. These experiments elucidate the way covalently bound phenyl units can change graphene's physical properties. Can we use chemistry to control electronic properties of graphene? What can we learn from well-known carbon allotropes like fullerenes? The surfaces of fullerenes and graphene show distinct differences in reactivity because of the high strain of sp² carbon in fullerenes compared with the complete lack of strain in graphene. Diazonium chemistry provides a versatile tool for attaching phenyl units covalently to carbon to produce advanced materials and electronic components, but diazonium-based carbon chemistry is strongly influenced by strain. Although fullerenes are highly reactive, graphite (stacks of graphene) remains relatively inert. We chemically introduce n- and p-like doping patterns in two-dimensional graphene using photolithography and extend the ability to chemically control doping to the chemical design of conducting and insulating areas. Thereby we can shape graphene surfaces into functional electronic devices. This Account also describes multistep synthesis on graphene-coated nanoparticles and the introduction of various functional groups on graphene surfaces. Only few functional groups can be produced directly via diazonium chemistry. To overcome this issue, we used these functional groups as starting points for more demanding organic reactions. We covalently attached chelating agents, catalysts, or polymers on the carbon surface. These more complex reactions facilitate the design of electronic modifications, intergraphene connections, and anchors for polymer incorporation. Diazonium chemistry forms strong covalent bridges between graphene and other areas of chemistry.},

A one-step solvothermal method featuring the reduction of graphene oxide and formation of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles was efficient, scalable, green, and controllable. The composite nanosheet was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which demonstrated that CuFe2O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm were densely and compactly deposited on GN. To investigate the formation mechanism of CuFe2O4-GN, we discussed in detail the effects of a series of experimental parameters, including the concentrations of the precursor, precipitation agent, stabilizer agent, and graphene oxide on the size and morphology of the resulting products. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the CuFe2O4-GN composite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The composite showed high electrochemical capacitance (576.6 F{\textperiodcentered}g-1 at 1 A{\textperiodcentered}g-1), good rate performance, and cycling stability. These results demonstrated that the composite, as a kind of electrode materials, had a high specific capacitance and good retention. The versatile CuFe2O4-GN holds great promise for application in a wide range of electrochemical fields because of the remarkable synergistic effects between CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and graphene. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms.

abstract = {Graphene and its derivatives are versatile building blocks for bottom-up assembly of advanced functional materials. In particular, with exceptionally large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and superior chemical/electrochemical stability, graphene represents the ideal material for various electrochemical energy storage devices including supercapacitors. However, due to the strong $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between graphene sheets, the graphene flakes tend to restack to form graphite-like powders when they are processed into practical electrode materials, which can greatly reduce the specific surface area and lead to inefficient utilization of the graphene layers for electrochemical energy storage. The self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene sheets into three-dimensional (3D) framework structures can largely retain the unique properties of individual graphene sheets and has recently garnered intense interest for fundamental investigations and potential applications in diverse technologies. In this Account, we review the recent advances in preparing 3D graphene macrostructures and exploring them as a unique platform for supercapacitor applications. We first describe the synthetic strategies, in which reduction of a graphene oxide dispersion above a certain critical concentration can induce the reduced graphene oxide sheets to cross-link with each other via partial $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking interactions to form a 3D interconnected porous macrostructure. Multiple reduction strategies, including hydrothermal/solvothermal reduction, chemical reduction, and electrochemical reduction, have been developed for the preparation of 3D graphene macrostructures. The versatile synthetic strategies allow for easy incorporation of heteroatoms, carbon nanomaterials, functional polymers, and inorganic nanostructures into the macrostructures to yield diverse composites with tailored structures and properties. We then summarize the applications of the 3D graphene macrostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. With a unique framework structure in which the graphene sheets are interlocked in 3D space to prevent their restacking, the graphene macrostructures feature very high specific surface areas, rapid electron and ion transport, and superior mechanical strength. They can thus be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes with excellent specific capacitances, rate capabilities, and cycling stabilities. We finally discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in this research field. By regarding the graphene as both a single-atom-thick carbon sheet and a conjugated macromolecule, our work opens a new avenue to bottom-up self-assembly of graphene macromolecule sheets into functional 3D graphene macrostructures with remarkable electrochemical performances. We hope that this Account will promote further efforts toward fundamental investigation of graphene self-assembly and the development of advanced 3D graphene materials for their real-world applications in electrochemical energy storage devices and beyond.},

These energy density values are comparable to that of the Ni metal hydride battery, but the supercapacitor can be charged or discharged in seconds or minutes.

abstract = {Exfoliation of graphite is a promising approach for large-scale production of graphene. Oxidation of graphite effectively facilitates the exfoliation process, yet necessitates several lengthy washing and reduction processes to convert the exfoliated graphite oxide (graphene oxide, GO) to reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Although filtration, centrifugation and dialysis have been frequently used in the washing stage, none of them is favorable for large-scale production. Here, we report the synthesis of RGO by sonication-assisted oxidation of graphite in a solution of potassium permanganate and concentrated sulfuric acid followed by reduction with ascorbic acid prior to any washing processes. GO loses its hydrophilicity during the reduction stage which facilitates the washing step and reduces the time required for production of RGO. Furthermore, simultaneous oxidation and exfoliation significantly enhance the yield of few-layer GO. We hope this one-pot and fully-scalable protocol paves the road toward out of lab applications of graphene.},

abstract = {This chapter describes the ´squalenoylation´ technology, a platform for the discovery of newnanomedicines. The design of nanomedicines is generally based on the physical encapsulation, adsorption, or entrapment of a drug in a nanocarrier. This generally results in poor drug loading, and often an uncontrolled fast release of the drug (known as burst release). To overcome those limitations, the squalenoylation concept is based onthe chemical (rather than physical) loading of drugs in nanomedicines. The idea is to link a biologically active compound (anticancer, antibiotic, antiviral, MRI imaging agent, etc.) to squalene, a natural and biocompatible lipid. Due to the unique, dynamically folded molecular conformation of squalene, the resulting squalene-drug bioconjugates self-assemble spontaneously in water to form nanoparticles. The resulting nanoassemblies havebeen shown to have enhanced pharmacological activity, and with reduced toxicity, thus paving the way to a new concept in the field of drug delivery.},

This one-atom-thick fabric of carbon uniquely combines extreme mechanical strength, exceptionally high electronic and thermal conductivities, impermeability to gases, as well as many other supreme properties, all of which make it highly attractive for numerous applications. Here we review recent progress in graphene research and in the development of production methods, and critically analyse the feasibility of various graphene applications.},

abstract = {Ultralarge graphene-based TiO2 nanosheet composites are successfully fabricated by a noncovalent functionalization approach with use of benzyl alcohol as the linking agent. In the synthetic procedure, the aromatic molecules of benzyl alcohol direct themselves onto graphene (GR) surface via $\pi$?$\pi$ interaction. Therefore, the basal planes of GR nanosheets are uniformly functionalized with hydroxyl groups derived from benzyl alcohol, which not only improves the dispersion of GR in solution but also induces a finely homogeneous coating of TiO2 nanocrystals onto the surface of GR nanosheets. The resulting GR@TiO2 nanocomposites, which feature unique ultralarge 2D sheet-like morphology with the lateral size far larger than the original GR and densely interfacial contact, are able to act as highly active photocatalysts toward selective reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to amines in water under ambient conditions. The higher photoactivity of GR@TiO2 than blank TiO2 is attributed to the efficient charge carriers separation and transfer by the GR platform. It is hoped that the facile synthesis strategy in this work could contribute to fabricating other ultralarge functional GR-based 2D sheet-onto-sheet composites with tunable morphology toward target photocatalytic applications.

The gel polymer exhibits flexible, high ionic conductivity and wide potential properties. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The electrode specific capacitance of the supercapacitor can be as high as 430.95 F g-1, and after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1 it still remains higher than 380 F g-1. The energy density and power density of the supercapacitor reach 57.94 Wh kg-1 and 59.84 kW kg-1, respectively. These novel flexible gel polymers are desirable for applications in supercapacitor devices.},

abstract = {We report the fabrication of graphene-encapsulated nanoballs with copper nanoparticle (Cu NP) cores whose size range from 40 nm to 1 $\mu$m using a solid carbon source of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The Cu NPs were prone to agglomerate during the annealing process at high temperatures of 800 to 900 °C when gas carbon source such as methane was used for the growth of graphene. On the contrary, the morphologies of the Cu NPs were unchanged during the growth of graphene at the same temperature range when PMMA coating was used. The solid source of PMMA was first converted to amorphous carbon layers through a pyrolysis process at the temperature regime of 400 °C, which prevented the Cu NPs from agglomeration, and they were converted to few-layered graphene (FLG) at the elevated temperatures. Raman and transmission electron microscope analyses confirmed the synthesis of FLG with thickness of approximately 3 nm directly on the surface of the Cu NPs. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, along with electrical resistance measurement according to temperature changes showed that the FLG-encapsulated Cu NPs were highly resistant to oxidation even after exposure to severe oxidation conditions.},

abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m−1) and −690 Nm−1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m−1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

The morphology and structure of the obtained material are examined by XRD, SEM, TEM and FT-IR. The size and morphology of the particles are influenced by the the concentration of AgNO 3 solution. Because of the existence of Ag particles, graphene sheets are well separated in the film obtained via vacuum filtration method. The electroconductibility of graphene/Ag film is investigated by four point resistivity test system. It is found that the electroconductibility of the film is increasing with the rising of the AgNO 3 solution concentration and the maximum value is 2.94scm -1 with the 0.15mol L -1 AgNO 3 solution.},
