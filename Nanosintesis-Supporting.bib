abstract = {The article focuses on graphene, an atomic two-dimensional (2D) crystalline matter composed of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice. It states that graphene is a gapless semiconductor with linear functions of momentum for valence-and conduction-band energies. It mentions the quantum mechanics of graphene electrons is identical to that of relativistic particles with small mass, and that its free-particle states are chiral.},
